# Horiseon Website Cleanup

## About this project
The goal of this project was to cleanup the HTML and CSS for a marketing company's homepage.

I began by tackling the issues with the HTML trying to make it more semantic. Most of the the issues resided in matching the HTML to the existing CSS.

Some issues made it so I had to also adjust the CSS to match the new elements and ID's after they were changed in the HTML.

The final product matched the given example of how the page was supposed to look.
